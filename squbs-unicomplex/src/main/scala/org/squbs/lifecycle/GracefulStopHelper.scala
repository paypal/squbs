/**
 * The trait provides some helper methods to support graceful stop of an actor
 * in Squbs framework
 *
 * Once you mix this trait in your actor, you can override stopTimeout to indicate
 * how much time this actor may need to stop it self.
 *
 * When the actor gets created, it will send the `stopTimeout` to its parent.
 * You can have the logic in the parent actor to decide to spend how much time to
 * stop its children
 *
 * If you want your actor to stop gracefully, you should put your stop logic in the
 * `receive` method responding to the `GracefulStop` message
