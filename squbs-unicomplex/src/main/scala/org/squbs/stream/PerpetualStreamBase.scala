  *       for which the last element is a Future</li>
  *   <li>This Future represents the state whether the stream is done</li>
  *   <li>The stream has the killSwitch as the first processing stage right behind the source</li>
  * </ol>Non-conforming implementations need to implement one or more of the provided hooks while
  * conforming implementations can well be supported by the default implementations.
