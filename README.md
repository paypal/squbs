Welcome to squbs (pronounced "skewbs")! We will assimilate your technology and culture. Resistance is futile.

squbs is a modular actor-based services framework build on top of Scala, Akka, and Spray. It is modeled after social and organizational paradigms dividing code into symbiotic groups or modules called "cubes." Cubes consist of a supervisory actor and other actors (you can call them "drones" if you like). The supervisory actor is responsible for handling or dispatching messages sent to the cube. Cubes and drones talk to each other asynchronously and work in synergy in an ongoing attempt to promote evolutions and perfect themselves.


##Definitions


*Unicomplex*: The core of squbs managing the actor system, bootstrapping, and possible actor capability directories and hot upgrading of the cubes.

*Cube*: A self contained module consisting of its own supervisory actor that gets bootstrapped. The cube's supervisory actor is looked up by name (actorFor) or by actorSelection and receives asynchronous messages through its actor interface.

*Service*: A cube that exposes itself as a REST service allowing access to functionality provided by the squbs ecosystem.

*Message*: Typed, asynchronous messages sent between actors and cubes.

*Drone*: Actors in a cube are also called drones.


##Problem

Large code bases have a large set of very deep dependencies. These dependencies often conflict between each other making it a challenge to manage these large systems. The code and dependency complexity is also a major hindrance for code to quickly evolve according to business needs. Testing of these large and complex systems become harder as the system grows. Enterprise integration solutions are generally applied to break complex such large systems into smaller, loosely coupled components but the weight of their integration mechanism is often an overkill. squbs is an attempt to provide a high performance asynchronous infrastructure that is lightweight and lends itself to high performance interaction between these loosely coupled cubes as well as within them.

In addition to systematically breaking down code complexity, squbs' fully asynchronous system also lends itself to newer web services technologies such as request/response multiplexing, streaming services, and server-sent events.


#Why do we need squbs?

Akka itself is a great system that enforces loose coupling. squbs is an attempt to add a modularity layer to Akka allowing actor libraries to be deployed as contained and isolated services. In addition, it also tries to provide implementations of common actor usage patterns allowing the developer to focus on the business logic instead of scopes and lifecycle management. It also provides for operationalization of the actor system for mission critical, fully monitored deployments.


#Future topics

* Hot upgrades of cubes while taking traffic

* Capability-based dependencies (I need cubes that can do "something" for me - not I need cube "somebody")

* Cube deployment database (I need to recall/upgrade all my cubes version x.y.z. Tell me where they are all deployed.)
