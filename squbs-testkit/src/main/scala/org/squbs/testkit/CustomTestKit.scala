 * to run in a separate process and allow for parallel tests. The only difficulty is it needs a started
 * UnicomplexBoot instance as the input. Usage:
 * <pre>
 *   class MyActorSpec extends CustomTestKit(UnicomplexBoot {name => ActorSystem(name)} .start()) {
 *     // Do the testing here.
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param boot The pre-configured, not started UnicomplexBoot object
