  * A Retry Settings class for configuring a Retry

  * Retry functionality requires each element passing through is uniquely identifiable for retrying, so
  * it requires a [[Context]], of any type carried along with the flow's input and output element as a
  * [[Tuple2]] (Scala) or [[Pair]] (Java).  The requirement is that either the [[Context]] type itself or a mapping
  * from [[Context]] should be able to uniquely identify each element passing through flow.
  *
  * Here are the ways a unique id can be provided:
  *
  *   - [[Context]] itself is a type that can be used as a unique id, e.g., [[Int]], [[Long]], [[java.util.UUID]]
  *   - [[Context]] extends [[UniqueId.Provider]] and implements [[UniqueId.Provider.uniqueId]] method
  *   - [[Context]] is of type [[UniqueId.Envelope]]
  *   - [[Context]] can be mapped to a unique id by calling {{{uniqueIdMapper}}}
  *
  * @param max     maximum number of retry attempts on any failures before giving up.
  * @param uniqueIdMapper function that maps [[Context]] to a unique id
  * @param failureDecider function to determine if an element passed by the joined [[Flow]] is
  *                       actually a failure or not
  * @param delay            to delay between retrying each failed element.
  * @param exponentialBackoffFactor exponential amount the delay duration will be increased upon each retry
  * @param maxDelay maximum delay duration for retry.
  * @param maxWaitingRetries maximum number of elements waiting to be retried.  Defaults to stream internal buffer size.
  * @tparam In      the type of elements pulled from upstream along with the [[Context]]
  * @tparam Out     the type of the elements that are pushed to downstream along with the [[Context]]
  * @tparam Context the type of the context that is carried along with the elements.
