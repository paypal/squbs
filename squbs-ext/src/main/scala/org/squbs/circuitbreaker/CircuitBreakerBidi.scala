/**
  * A bidi [[GraphStage]] that is joined with a [[Flow]] to add Circuit Breaker functionality.  When the joined [[Flow]]
  * is having trouble responding in time or is responding with failures, then based on the provided settings, it
  * short circuits the [[Flow]]: Instead of pushing an element to the joined [[Flow]], it directly pushes down a
  * [[Failure]] or a fallback response to downstream, given that there is downstream demand.
  *
  * It accepts a [[CircuitBreakerState]] that keeps circuit breaker state.  The user can select a
  * [[CircuitBreakerState]] implementation that is right for the use case.  Please note, in many scenarios, a
  * [[CircuitBreakerState]] might need to be shared across materializations or even different streams.  In such
  * scenarios, make sure to select a [[CircuitBreakerState]] implementation that can work across materializations
  * concurrently.
  *
  * A [[fallback]] function can be passed to provide an alternative response when circuit is OPEN, .
  *
  * The joined [[Flow]] pushes down a [[Try]].  By default, any [[Failure]] is considered a problem and causes the
  * circuit breaker failure count to be incremented.  However, [[CircuitBreakerBidi]] also accepts a [[failureDecider]]
  * to decide on if an element passed by the joined [[Flow]] is actually considered a failure.  For instance, if
  * Circuit Breaker is joined with an Akka HTTP flow, a [[Success]] Http Response with status code 500 internal server
  * error should be considered a failure.
  *
  *
  * '''Emits when''' an element is available from the joined [[Flow]] or a short circuited element is available
  *
  * '''Backpressures when''' the downstream backpressures
  *
  * '''Completes when''' upstream completes
  *
  * '''Cancels when''' downstream cancels
  *
  * Please note, if the upstream does not control the throughput, then the throughput of the stream might temporarily
  * increase once the circuit is OPEN:  The downstream demand will be addressed with short circuit/fallback messages,
  * which might (or might not) take less time than it takes the joined [[Flow]] to process an element.  To eliminate
  * this problem, a throttle can be applied specifically for circuit breaker related messages.
