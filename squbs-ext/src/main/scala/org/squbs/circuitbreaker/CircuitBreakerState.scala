/**
  * Holds the state of the circuit breaker.  Transitions through three states:
  *
  * `Closed`: elements/requests/calls run through the main logic until the `maxFailures` count is reached.  If
  * `maxFailures` is reached, it transitions to `Open` state.
  *
  * `Open`:  Short circuits.  A [[scala.util.Failure]] or a fallback response is returned.  After `resetTimeout`, it
  * transitions to `HalfOpen` state.
  *
  * `HalfOpen`: the first element/request/call will be allowed through the main logic, if it succeeds the circuit
  * breaker will reset to `Closed` state.  If it fails, the circuit breaker will re-open to `Open` state.  All
  * elements/requests/calls beyond the first that execute while the first is running will fail-fast with
  * [[scala.util.Failure]] or a fallback response.
  *
  * An [[ActorRef]] can be subscribed to receive certain events, e.g., [[TransitionEvents]] to receive all state
  * transition events or specific state transition event like [[Open]].
  *
  * It collects metrics for success, failure and short-circuit counts.  Also, exposes the state as a gauge.
