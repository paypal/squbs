# Configuration Reference

The followings lists the squbs configuration as defined in `reference.conf`:

```

  # Name of the actor system for squbs to create.
  actorsystem-name = "squbs"

  # graceful stop timeout
  # default timeout for one actor to process a graceful stop
  # if extends the trait org.squbs.lifecycle.GracefulStopHelper
  default-stop-timeout = 3s

  # An external configuration directory to supply external application.conf. The location of this directory
  # is relative to the working directory of the squbs process.
  external-config-dir = squbsconfig

  # An external configuration file name list. Any file with the name in the list under the external-confi-dir will be
  # loaded during squbs initialization for Actor System settings. Implicit "application.conf" will be loaded
  # besides this file name list
  external-config-files = []

  # Service infra configuration.

    # Maximum amount of time to wait for all listeners to be started.
    timeout = 60s
    # Maximum amount of time each listener is given to start.
    listener-timeout = 10s
  }
}

  # All squbs listeners carry the type "squbs.listener"
  type = squbs.listener

  # Add aliases for the listener in case the cube's route declaration binds to a listener with a different name.
  # Just comma separated names are good, like...
  # aliases = [ foo-listener, bar-listener ]
  aliases = []

  # Service bind to particular address/interface. The default is 0.0.0.0 which is any address/interface.
  bind-address = "0.0.0.0"

  # Whether or not using full host name for address binding
  full-address = false

  # Service bind to particular port. 8080 is the default.
  bind-port = 8080

  # Listener uses HTTPS?
  secure = false

  # HTTPS needs client authorization? This configuration is not read if secure is false.
  need-client-auth = false

  # Any custom SSLContext provider? Setting to "default" means platform default.
  ssl-context = default

  # Which materializer to use for HTTP streams.  default-materializer is used if not specified

## Blocking Dispatcher

The squbs `reference.conf` declares a `blocking-dispatcher` used for blocking I/O calls. This is a standard Akka dispatcher configuration. Please see [dispatchers](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.13/scala/dispatchers.html) in the Akka documentation for more detail.

## Listeners

A listener defines a port binding and the behavior of this port binding such as security, authentication, etc. A default listener is provided by the squbs `reference.conf`. This can be overridden by the application providing its `application.conf` file or the `application.conf` file in its external config directory. Please see [Bootstrapping squbs](bootstrap.md#configuration-resolution) for details how squbs reads its configuration file.

A listener is declared at the root level of the configuration file. The name generally follows the pattern `*-listener` but this is not a requirement. What defines the entry as a listener is the `type` field under the listener entry. It must be set to `squbs.listener`. Please see the `default-listener` example above on how to configure new listeners listening to different ports.

A declared listener is not started unless a service route attaches itself to this listener. In other words, just declaring the listener does not automatically cause the listener to start unless there is a real use for the listener.

## Materializers

A squbs materializer is nothing but an Akka Streams `Materializer` that is specified in the configuration.  This allows squbs to keep a registry of all materializers so that:

   * a `Materializer` can be accessed from different locations through an Akka Extension as follows:

     **Scala**
   
     ```scala
     implicit val mat = Unicomplex(system).materializer("default-materializer")
     ```
   
     **Java**
   
     ```java
     final Materializer mat = Unicomplex.get(system).materializer("default-materializer")
     ```

   * a materializer can be referenced from a [squbs listener](#listeners).
   * The materializers in use by an application can be reported on JMX with the corresponding settings.

A default materializer is provided by the squbs `reference.conf`.  Materializer creation is lazy.  Only the ones that are actually in use are created.

A materializer is declared at the root level of the configuration file. The name generally follows the pattern `*-materializer` but this is not a requirement. What defines the entry as a materializer is the `type` field under the listener entry. It must be set to `squbs.materializer`. Please see the `default-materializer` example above on how to configure new materializers.

## Pipeline

If defined, a default pipeline is installed for pre-processing every single request and post-processing every response. Services can specify a different pipeline, or none at all as described under [Bootstrapping squbs](bootstrap.md#services). Applications or infrastructure can implement their own pipelines for pre-processing needs such as logging or tracing. Please see detailed description of pipelines under [Request/Response Pipeline](pipeline.md).
