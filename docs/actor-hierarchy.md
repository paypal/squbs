#Unicomplex Actor Hierarchy

![image](img/squbs-actor-hierarchy.png)

squbs sets up the actor and component hierarchy shown in the above picture to support a modular runtime for actors and services running in a squbs system.

* **ActorSystem** - This is the akka ActorSystem. A squbs system uses one single actor system to support all services and cubes. This will ensure that we have a single control point for dispatchers running in a squbs system. The ActorSystem name is "squbs" by default but can be overridden by overriding the settings in application.conf.

* **Unicomplex** - This is the core singleton actor that manages the squbs system. It registers all cubes and communicates with the web-service actor and the cube supervisors for lifecycle management of the system. It is also responsible for starting the web-service and service-registrar actors. Applications or system components can access the ActorRef of Unicomplex by calling `Unicomplex()`

* **Listeners** - The listeners are actors that bind with `IO(HTTP)` in Spray. They carry the name of the configured listeners in `reference.conf` or `application.conf`. By default, the default-listener binds port 8080 on address 0.0.0.0 (any interface) without using https. However, this can be overridden in `application.conf`. Additional listeners can be configured in `reference.conf` or `application.conf` of the library or application, respectively.

* **RouteDefinition** - RouteDefinition is itself not an actor, but a route registration in form of a class extending the RouteDefinition trait. The routes in registered services (or RouteDefinitions) are executed by its corresponding route actor.

* **Route actors** - Actors of type org.squbs.unicomplex.RouteActor created by the CubeSupervisor to host each RouteDefinition. Therefore they becomes children supervised by the corresponding CubeSupervisor they belong to. The route actors are automatically registered against all the listeners they are bound to, allowing request parts from the listener to be dispatched to the route actor.

* **Request handler actors** - Instead of using RouteDefinition for services, developers may choose to work at the spray-can layer and not touch spray-routing and thus register a spray-can request handler actor instead. Working at the spray-can layer generally consumes less memory and allows handling of streaming requests but is harder to code when compared to the spray-routing DSL.

* **CubeSupervisors** - CubeSupervisors are created directly from the actor system and register themselves with the Unicomplex. One instance of the CubeSupervor is created per cube. They act as the supervisor for any route actor and registered (well-known) actor that can be looked up by name and handle errors and restarts for these actors. They are responsible for the lifecycle of their children. Well-known actors requiring initialization will declare such needs in the squbs-meta.conf file. They will communicate with their parent - the CubeSupervisor for their initialization status. The CubeSupervisor will again communicate lifecycle status and initialization updates to the Unicomplex which maintains the lifecycle state for the whole system. Please refer to [Bootstraping](bootstrap.md) for information about cube and service configuration entries in the squbs-meta.conf and [Runtime Lifecycle & API](lifecycle.md) for lifecycle states and lifecycle status updates. In addition, the cube structure also provides namespacing for well-known actors preventing naming conflicts between well-known actors supplied by different cubes. Route actors are technically equivalent to well known actors.

* **Well-known actors** - These actors are registered actors that get started by the CubeSupervisor. They register and provide basic startup information such as routers through squbs-meta.conf. Please refer to [Bootstrapping](bootstrap.md) for detailed information about cube configuration. You can provide additional configuration through the cube's reference.conf. Please refer to the [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) library documentation for specification and details of reference.conf and application.conf.
