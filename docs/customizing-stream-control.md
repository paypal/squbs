# Customizing Stream Control

Akka Streams/Reactive stream needs to be integrated with the [Runtime Lifecycle](lifecycle.md) of the server. For this, an automated or semi-automated integration is provided through the [`PerpetualStream`](perpetualstream.md) infrastructure. If you need even more fine-grained control over stream, the following sections explain such facilities.

### Dependency

In general, you do not need to add an extra dependency. The classes are part of the following dependency:

```scala
"org.squbs" %% "squbs-unicomplex" % squbsVersion
```


## Making A Lifecycle-Sensitive Source

If you wish to have a source that is fully connected to the lifecycle events of squbs, you can wrap any source with `LifecycleManaged`.

**Scala**

```scala
val inSource = <your-original-source>
val aggregatedSource = LifecycleManaged().source(inSource)
```

**Java**

```java
final Source inSource = <your-original-source>
final Source aggregatedSource = new LifecycleManaged().source(inSource);
```

The resulting source will be an aggregated source materialize to a `(T, ActorRef)` where `T` is the materialized type of `inSource` and `ActorRef` is the materialized type of the trigger actor which receives events from the Unicomplex, the squbs container.

The aggregated source does not emit from original source until lifecycle becomes `Active`, and stop emitting element and shuts down the stream after lifecycle state becomes `Stopping`.

## Custom Aggregated Triggered Source
If you want your flow to enable/disable to custom events, you can integrate with a custom trigger source,
element `true` will enable, `false` will disable.

Note that `Trigger` takes an argument `eagerComplete` which defaults to `false` in Scala but has to be
passed in Java. If `eagerComplete` is set to `false`, completion and/or termination of the trigger source actor
will detach the trigger. If set to `true`, such termination will complete the stream.

##### Scala

```scala
import org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent._

val inSource = <your-original-source>
val trigger = <your-custom-trigger-source>.collect {
  case 0 => DISABLE
  case 1 => ENABLE
}

val aggregatedSource = new Trigger().source(inSource, trigger)
```

##### Java

```java
import static org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent.DISABLE;
import static org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent.ENABLE;

final Source<?, ?> inSource = <your-original-source>;
final Source<?, ?> trigger = <your-custom-trigger-source>.collect(new PFBuilder<Integer, TriggerEvent>()
    .match(Integer.class, p -> p == 1, p -> ENABLE)
    .match(Integer.class, p -> p == 0, p -> DISABLE)
    .build());

final Source aggregatedSource = new Trigger(false).source(inSource, trigger);
```

## Custom Lifecycle Event(s) for Trigger
If you want to respond to more lifecycle events beyond `Active` and `Stopping`, for example you want `Failed` to also stop the flow, you can modify the lifecylce event mapping.

##### Scala

```scala
import org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent._

val inSource = <your-original-source>
val trigger = Source.actorPublisher[LifecycleState](Props.create(classOf[UnicomplexActorPublisher]))
  .collect {
    case Active => ENABLE
    case Stopping | Failed => DISABLE
  }

val aggregatedSource = new Trigger().source(inSource, trigger)
```

##### Java

```java
import static org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent.DISABLE;
import static org.squbs.stream.TriggerEvent.ENABLE;

final Source<?, ?> inSource = <your-original-source>;
final Source<?, ActorRef> trigger = Source.<LifecycleState>actorPublisher(Props.create(UnicomplexActorPublisher.class))
    .collect(new PFBuilder<Integer, TriggerEvent>()
        .matchEquals(Active.instance(), p -> ENABLE)
        .matchEquals(Stopping.instance(), p -> DISABLE)
        .matchEquals(Failed.instance(), p -> DISABLE)
        .build()
    );

final Source aggregatedSource = new Trigger(false).source(inSource, trigger);
```
